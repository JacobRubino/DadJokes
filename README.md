## Description

This is a Dad Joke Translator. Everyone loves a good dad joke, and learning a language is hard enough, so we've created this site to make learning languages a little easier. Everyday you can learn a new joke in a new language, and be the funniest one in the room while doing it.

## Usage

2. Read the Dad Joke of the Day in English. <br>
3. Click the dropdown menu on the right hand side of the page to choose which language you would like the joke of the day to be translated to. <br>
4. You also have the option to translate yesterday's joke of the day. <br>
