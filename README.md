## Description

This is a Dad Joke Translator. Everyone loves a good dad joke, and learning a language is hard enough. We've created this application to make learning languages a little easier. Everyday you can learn a new joke in a new language, and be the funniest one in the room in many languages! It's up to you to remember the punchline.
