    <h1>About Dad Jokes</h1>
    <p>Dad Jokes is a website designed for those who enjoy (for lack of better words) Dad Jokes. "Dad" jokes are typically presented as one-liners that stereotypically are told to intentionally provoke a negative reaction to their overly-simplistic humor. The origin of the "Dad Joke" dates back to 1987 when the Gettysburg Times published an article titled, "Don't ban the 'dad' jokes; preserve and revere them". Nowadays, a large variety of diverse "Dad" jokes are avilable at anytime at the "Dad Jokes" website.   </p>
